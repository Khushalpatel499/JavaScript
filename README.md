# JavaScript(ECMA script)
# Introduction
  1. Javascript is a high level,object oriented and multi paradigm(use different style of programming like: imperative and declarative) programming language.
  2. It allow to dynamic and interactive effect to any webpage.
  3. Javascript on browser called front end website while javascript on webserver(with nodejs) is called backend website. we can also used to develop native mobile or desktop application.
  4. Values is a piece of data. 
  5. Variables name like in different ways    a. camelcase (ex: firstName) b. ex: first_name_person
  6. In js value are mainly two types 1. object(ex: let me ={name: "khushal"};) 2. Primitive (ex: let firstName ="khushal");
  7. There are 7 primitive data types : 1. number(ex: let marks=5;)
                                        2. string (ex: let myName = "khushal";)
                                        3. bool (ex: let checker = true;)
                                        4. undefined (ex; let childeren;)
                                        5. null (empty value)
                                        6. Symbol( value that is unique and cannot be changed (not used for now))
                                        7. BigInt(larger integers than the number type can hold )
  8. Js has dynaming typing that means we dont have to manually define datatype
  9. Value has a type not variable.(IMP)
  10. Comment : single line //  multiple line /*  */
  11. There are three ways to declare variables in js : 1. let (blocked scope) 2. var(function scoped) 3. const(are immutable means cant declare empty const variable)
  12. Operators : 1. mathmetical or airthmetic operator   2. assignment operator  3. Comparsion operator
  13. Template literal : writes string in more normal way and add varibles between them normally.(used backticks ``)
  14.Type Conversion (manually convert from one type to another) , Type Coercion(js automatically converts types).
