 //Array

 1. collection of items in linear
 ex> let marks =[1,2,3,4];
     let info =['rahuk',86,'delhi'];(not used mainly to store different type of data but we can)
2. it is mainly used to store similar type of information.
3. to print length using property : marks.legth
4. array is a type of object in js it key is indexes.
5. to access indexes arr[0],arr[1]..
6. array is mutable means if we change value at index then it change in main array while string is immutable.

// looping over array 
1. for ,for-of ,for-in


// array methods(there are two way one which change array and other doen't change array but return new array)

1. push():add to end , change in the array
2. pop(): delete from end & return,change in the array
3. toString(): converts array to string,create new string not change array
4. concat(): joins multiples arrays and returns result
5. ushift(): add to start
6. shift(): delete from start and return 
7. slice(): return a piece of the array not change original array;
            slice(starindx,endidx) //end index not include
8. splice(): change original array(add,remove,replace)
         splice(startindex,deletecount(numberofitemdelete withstarting index),newelement toadd)

9. if we enter single index in splice it will delete all the array from that index reutrn remaining array.
