1. learn all to call api end points and recevie data
2. help to this make project of currency convertor.



//Fetch API:

1. we send a request to api and he send some response.
2. to call api we use fetch api's.
3.API- Application Programming interface.
4 .  search on google free api those api have their documentation to that how to use and this api return data in a object format when we send request on link.
5. Api is nothing but end points or url end points to send request and we get response.
6. search api: https://free-apis.github.io/#/browse
7. the fetch api provides an interface for fetching (sending/receiving) resources.
8. It uses Request and Response objects.
9. The fetch() method is used to fetch a resource(data).

 syntax: let promise =fetch(url,[options])
 // we write fetch method and write url inside and do this send a req to this url and return a promise and there some option also in fetch.

 10.it give promiseResult as response , with status 200 means success
 11. to get data from promise we have promoise chaining .then .catch but there is a more way.
 12. asyc await is better way.
 13. when we send req to api and when data return to us there is no reload to our page.
 14. whenever we used fetch method and not send any option then fetch method create a particular type of request GET request.
 15. GET Request: the request which bring some some data from any api or server.
 16. we got the data in console and in browser is in form of different format.

 //Understanding Terms:

 1.AJAX is asynchronous js and XML
    early when their is no modern js then network request means api request,early data come in xml format but now days come in json format.
 2. data format:  sending data in different format (like money to give in cash,netbanking,upi);
 3. JSON is javascript object notation(it look like js object)
 4. in our code the response come in format of jason .
 5. today maximum api respond data in json format so we also called that ajaj;
 6. still today the exchange (network of network req) it called  ajax.
 7. how the api call works, when we first send the api request it get some response this response is in json format we have to convert this in js object.
 8. to convert we use json() method is also a async method it also return promise..
 9. json() method: returns a second promise that resolves with the result of parsing the response body text as JSON.(Input is JSON, output is JS object).
 10. this usable data contain a array

 //Requests and Response

 1. whenvever we send request to api or server then it contain some http verbs(hyper text transfer protocol) and verbs tell which type of request we send
 ex: GET,HEAD,POST,PUT,DELETE,CONNECT,OPTIONS,TRACE,PATCH

2. Response status code: 200 means success,client side error is 400, api error or server side error 500

3. when ever we send req and receive  response their is an header
4. http response headers also contain details about the responses,such as content type,HTTP status code etc.

//learn about sending POST req


//Now create  a currency convertor
1. for flags we use flagsapi and use font awesome cdnjs
