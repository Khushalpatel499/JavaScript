 //Loops:
 1. it is used to execute a piece of code agian and again.
 2. for loop:  for(let i=1;i<=5;i++){
                 }
 3.while: while(condition){
 }

 4.do-while: the condition check last;
 it run mininum one time at least .
 do{
 }while(condition);

 5. infinite loop:never ends ex:for(int i=1;i>=0;i++){
 }
 
 6. for-of loop: it help to loop over string and arrays
 ex: for(let val of str){
 }

 7.for-in loop: it is used for objects or arrays it give use the key
 for(let key in objVar){
 }


//Strings:
1. it is a sequence of character used to represent text.
2. let str ="khushal" ; or let str='khushal';
3. string have inbuild property or function: str.length
   we can also access indivual character by str[0],str[1]
4. from this it look like it behave as object like object have key and from that we get value similar for string.
 
//template literals: 
1. a way to have embedded expression in strings.
2  ex: let x=`this is me`;
   it help to write variable and string in one line.
   ex: console.log("my name ${obj.name}");
     the variable data come by ${};
     but here the template literal is part of string so it is string not the type which was define earlier. 
  string interpolation: to create strings by doing substitution of placeholders.

//escape character:
1. \n ->next line ex: console.log("my \n name");
2. \t= tab space(space between)
3. in legth if we calulcate then it count as single character still there are two \ or n.

//Strings Method:
1. there are in built methods.
2. str.toUpperCase();
2. str.toLowerCase();
3. str.trim(); to remove white spaces from starting and end.
4. these are method not change the original one it create new value.
5.in js strings are immutable (not change).
6. str.slice(start,end?); // return part of string but end is not include
7.str1.concat(str2); //join str2 with str1 or str1+str2;
8. str.replace(searchVal,newVal);//replace the first one match value for all value do str.replaceAll();
9. str.charAt(indx);
