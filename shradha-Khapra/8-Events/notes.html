 //Events

 1. it is basically some changes in our code(ex: if we have a button and we click it then it is an event)
 2. each node of dom can provide some events.
 3.the change in state of an object is known as an event.
 4. events are fired to notify code of "interesting changes" that may affect code execution.
 5. Ex:mouse click(click,double click),kyboard event(keypress,keyup,keydown),form event(submit),print event.
 6. event can also be generate using environment like we have battery less than 20 then battery saver on that is also an event.
 7.  inline event handling is difficult so we have do in js using first acces the node and then apply the event on that using dotevent.
 8. arrow function have to invoke by calling them.(IMP)

      node.event=()=>{
      //handle here
      }

 9.  if we handle inline event and js handle then the priority is for js handle.
 10. handler: it is a function that run after any event fire
 
 11. if we handle same element with same event then the last one overwritte all previous one.
 

 //Event object:
 1. It is a special object that has detail about the event.
 2. event detail : which type of event(mouse,pointer,keybord etc).
 3. event target: where event apply(ex: div or button or etc);
 4. all event handlers have access to the event object's properties and methods.

   node.event =(e)=>{
   //handle here
   }

 5. whenever we define our handler we can write a special argument here which is event object.
 6.clientx: where horizontally our event occur on screen
   clinety: where vertically our event occur.

 7. e.type,e.target,e.clientX,e.clientY



//Event listener:
1. we have seen two way to handle event first is inline and other is in js to write node with event and an function.
2.first inline have draw back that it make code bulkier.
3.second  has drawback thatin one i we can write s single  function to handle a event

4. one better way to handle events is event listner, they are listner(ready) for event and when event come start their work.
5. for one event we can create multiple event listner.

node.addEventListener(event,callback);
node.removeEventListener(event,callback);

note: the callback reference should be same to remove

  btn1.addEventListener("click", () => {
  console.log("button 1 again is here");
});
btn1.removeEventListener("click", () => {
  console.log("button 1 again is here");
});

this event handle doesn't remove because both handler are different place in memory

so for same referece we have to store it somewhere.
let handle =()=>{
 console.log("button 1 again is here");
}

btn1.addEventListener('click',handle);
btn2.removeEventListner('click',handle);



6. it take two values event(click,dbclick etc) and callback function it will occur when the event occur.this callback is also called event handler.
7.
