 //Operators:
 1. to perform operation on data
 2. Arithmetic: modulus,expoenentation,increment,decrement.
         a+b is a expression , a and b are iperands and + is operator.
 3. To print two think in single log console.log(a-b,a+b); use comma.
 4. modulus: % - give remender value.
    exponentiation: ** - a**b means a power b;
    unary operator : ++ and --
 5. Assignment Operators:
   =,+=,-=,*=,%=,**=
 6. Comparison operators:(return boolean)
     equal to == ,equal to &type ===, not equal to !=,not equal to &type !==,>=,>,<,<=
 7. if a=5 and b="5" a==b give true but one is number and one is string but in js it implicitly convert string into number so it give true.
 8. so we use strict equal to which compare both number and type.
 9. logical operator: and(&&),or(||),Not(!) (it also give true or false)
        and = both true then true else false
        or - at least one true 
        != if true then give false and vice versa
 10.Bitwise operator: &,|
 

 //conditional statement

 1. to implement some condition.
 2. if: if(conditon){}
 3. if-else: if(condition){}else{}
 4. else-if: if(condition){}else if(condition){}else{}
 5. switch: switch(expression){
       case "one":
       break;
       case "two":
       break;
       default:
 
 }

 //ternary operator(it work on three operands condition ,first output,second output)
 1. condition? trueoutput:falseoutput
 ex: age>18?"adult":"not adult";

Imp: there are two think in js prompt and alert :
  alert is a message, it show as a popup one time
  prompt is also give a message but it can take input also so now that inpput we can save in a variable but it convert every think into string.
