 //Basic:
 1. console is the place where we can write our js code and run their and see output, to clean console ctrl+k.
 2. alert("apna college") press enter see a popup.
 3. but we can't write all code there becuase when we press refresh or ctrl+r then it gone.
 4. Console.log("apna college"); is used to log(print) a message to the console.
 5. .js is extension for save.
 6. so how to print the js code in browser for that we need a html file.
 
 //Variables:
 1.variables are container for data.
 2.variables name should be meaning .
 3. js is a dynamically typed language means in many lauguage we have to defined type like it is int,float or string but not in js.
 4. in basic we don't have to tell js the type it will show on code when running.
 5. = is a assingment operator. like a=b it doesnot mean a is euqal to b is means assign value of b in a;
 6. variable are case sensitive like apple and Apple are different.
 7. reserved words cannot be variable name.
 8. camel case (fullName) is a good way to write variable name.
 9. snake case(full_name),full-name(kabab case),FullName(Pascal case) not used mainly.
 10. age =24 it not give error but it is not good way we have to use keywords first.
 11. let,const and var(used in old js)
     let: variable cannot re-declared but can updated.a block scope variable.
     var: variable can be redeclared and update. a global scope variable.
     const: variable cannot be redeclared and updated. a block scope variable.
 12.it is not neccessary to decalred a varible (like let a=5;) we can define also(let a;) but the default value is undefined but const have be decalred always.
 
 //Data-Types:
 1.Number,String,Boolean,Undefined,Null,BigInt,Symbol
 2. two types: Primitive(7) and  non-primitive(objects(Arrays,Functions))
 3. Number: let a =3; to check use typeof a
    String: let fullName ="khushal"
    Boolean: let isFollow =true
    undefined: let x
    null: let y =null; but here typeof y is object ,null means absence of an object
    BigInt:let z=BigInt("123") :output: 123n
    Symbol: let v =Symbol("Hello");output:Symbol(Hello)
 4.Object is collection of values; like for student there are different value like: name as String,age as number, isPass as Boolean all this values for student is a collection.
 5. in general object store key:value pair.({age:24,name:"Khushal"})
 6. generally object declared with const 
    const student ={
                        fullName: "khushal",
                        age:20,
                        isPass:true,
                 };
7.to access object keys: student["fullName"] or student.fullName;
8. to assign new values in object: student["age"] =student["age"]+1;
9. now the question is that student is const we are change the age how it is possible?
Ans: we cannot change const variable but can change const object keys becuase object is collection to get error in object we have to change whole object.
10. in js if 123 +1 = 124 while "123"+1 ='1231' it will not add in number it will add in string.
